# Project 5: WTWR

This [project] (https://kimyonsoo.github.io/se_project_react/) is part of the full stack application of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using JSX, HTML and CSS to get React working in Vite, based on the design brief given on [Figma] (https://www.figma.com/design/bfVOvqlLmoKZ5lpro8WWBe/Sprint-14_-WTWR?node-id=1-598&t=HCQJQ49Vj8Fm8mr8-0). The setup utilizes an API collecting the weather data on daily basis to process what would be suitable for wearing based on the location and climate of a user.
